## name-db
*name-db* is a collection of names in all languages. Our goal is to collect as much data as we can, and to provide an open-source free API for name translations.

# Specs
*name-db* currently stores only **first names**, in a *UTF-8* JSON format.
*names.json* is an array of *name objects*. Each *name object* has the following structure:

```js
{
    "name": "", // English name
    "meaning": "", // The meaning of the name, in English
    "translations": {
        "{language code}": "{translation}" 
    }
}
``` 

The language codes are [ISO 639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) codes. For a list of language codes, please see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes

Note that everything except the translations should be in English.
