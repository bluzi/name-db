# name-db
> `name-db` is a collection of names in all languages. Our goal is to collect as much data as we can, and to provide an open-source free API for name translations.

# Important notice for returning contributors
**`names.json` is *deprecated*.**

From now on, names are stored in `collection/` directory.

Each name has a separated file. 

The structure of the name object is the same.

## Specs

*name-db* currently stores only **first names**.

Each name is stored in a JSON file, located in `collection/`. The following is the structure of a name file:

**`collection/{lowercase name}.json:`**

```js
{
    "name": "", // English name, lowercase, coresponding to the filename
    "meaning": "", // The meaning of the name, in English
    "aliases": [], // An array of lowercase alias names, such as: richard -> dick, daniel -> dan, etc.
    "translations": {
        "{lowercase ISO-639-3 language code}": "{translation}" 
    }
}
``` 

**Example:**

**`collections/jonathan.json`**

```js
{
    "name": "jonathan",
    "meaning": "Hebrew for \"YHWH has given\"",
    "aliases": [
        "johnathan",
        "john",
        "yonathan"
    ], 
    "translations": {
        "heb": "ג'ונתן" 
    }
}
``` 

The language codes are [ISO 639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) codes. For a list of language codes, please see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-3_codes

> Note that everything except the translations should be in English.
